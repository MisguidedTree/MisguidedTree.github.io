A great writing exercise to help process adverse events is to record your ABCs.

A - Activating event that triggers your inner dialogue
B - Belief that you formed after the event
C - Consequences or how your belief makes you feel

First, we identify an event that triggers an internal dialogue.
When we have found such an incident, we are then able to confirm any Belief that was made as a result of this event.
Finally, we consider the consequences of the new Belief and how this effects us.

This technique assists in the catching of new behaviour in the aftermath of a traumatic event.
By following the steps, we can determine if the new Belief is a positive or negative change.
If this is a negative change, we are then able to take steps to disprove the new belief and improve how we feel about ourselves as a result.
